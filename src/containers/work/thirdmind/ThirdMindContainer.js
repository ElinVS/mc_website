          <p>Created by composer Matthew Collings and visual artist Erik Parr, The Third Mind is an interactive audio-visual app, performance and installation that explores the idea of ‘algorithmic cinema’.

              The project is an interactive space that combines cinema, music, 'foley' and live action performed by Matthew Collings (guitar, electronics, prepared amplifier, live foley), Christos Michalakos (percussion, electronics) and Erik Parr (visual processing).

              The project was premiered at the Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow, March 5-6th 2013 in association with Cryptic Nights. It was supported by an Alt-W Production award from New Media Scotland.</p>
